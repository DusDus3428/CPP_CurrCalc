# Goal of CurrCalc
CurrCalc is a small C++ program that converts an amount of money from one currency to another. The amount, initial currency, and target currency are provided by the user, while the list of currency names and currency details are fetched from this API: https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/.

This is my first real C++ project and I intend to use it as a practice ground to learn about C++. I will document my progress in a series of blog posts that you can find on my website: . Feel free to join the discussion there!

# Software Design
You can find the documentation to the software's design [here](./documentation/README.md).
